# DEPLOY LOCAL SIMPLE WAY

Deploying a Spring Boot application on a local server within your enterprise involves several steps. Here's a general guide to get you started:

1. **Prepare your Spring Boot application:**
   
   - Ensure your Spring Boot application is properly configured and packaged. You should have a `.jar` or `.war` file ready for deployment. You can build this using Maven or Gradle.

2. **Install Java on the server:**
   
   - Make sure Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your local server. You can download and install it from the official Java website if it's not already installed.

3. **Copy your application to the server:**
   
   - Transfer your packaged Spring Boot application (`.jar` or `.war` file) to your local server. You can use SCP, FTP, or any other file transfer method you prefer.

4. **Run the application:**
   
   - Once the application is on the server, you can run it using the Java command line. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your `.jar` or `.war` file is located, and execute the following command:
     
     Copy code
     
     `java -jar your-application-name.jar`
     
     Replace `your-application-name.jar` with the actual name of your application file.

5. **Configure server ports and settings:**
   
   - Ensure that the server ports your Spring Boot application is using do not conflict with other services running on the server. You can configure the port in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

6. **Check application logs:**
   
   - Monitor the logs of your Spring Boot application to ensure that it starts successfully and to troubleshoot any issues if they arise. Logs are usually written to the console by default but can be configured to write to files.

7. **Access your application:**
   
   - Once your application is up and running, you should be able to access it using a web browser or API client. If you're using the default configurations, your application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

8. **Security considerations:**
   
   - Ensure that proper security measures are in place, especially if your application deals with sensitive data. This might include securing server access, configuring firewalls, enabling HTTPS, etc.

9. **Monitoring and maintenance:**
   
   - Regularly monitor your application for performance issues, errors, and security vulnerabilities. Perform necessary maintenance tasks such as applying updates and patches to keep your application and server secure and up-to-date.
