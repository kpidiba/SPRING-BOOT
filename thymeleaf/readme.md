# THYMELEAF

**Thymeleaf** is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments.

Thymeleaf's main goal is to bring elegant *natural templates* to your development workflow — HTML that can be correctly displayed in browsers and also work as static prototypes, allowing for stronger collaboration in development teams.

With modules for Spring Framework, a host of integrations with your favourite tools, and the ability to plug in your own functionality, Thymeleaf is ideal for modern-day HTML5 JVM web development — although there is much more it can do.
